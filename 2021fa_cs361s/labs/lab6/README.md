## Overview
This lab is very simple. Solve an "easy" CTF SQL injection challenge. Head
over to [CTF Learn](https://ctflearn.com). Create an account. You need to capture
the flag for [this exercise](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/88). If you want
the direct link, it takes you to [this webpage](https://web.ctflearn.com/web4/).

## SQL Injection

Similar to injecting Javascript into a webform to corrupt a webpage, 
you can also inject SQL statements into a webform to trick the server
into giving more info out of the database. This attack works against websites
that have not sanitized the input to their database queries.

I don't want to spoil too much. If you want to know more about how this works
try going to [this tutorial](https://ctflearn.com/lab/sql-injection-part-1).

## Additional Challenges

If you already know how to do an SQL injection and this lab takes you all of five
minutes, feel free to try some other challenges for fun. You do not need to turn
these in. It is simply a suggestion to expand your experience if you already know
how to do this.

## Submission and Grading

This is a pass/fail lab. Please submit the flag (you'll know it when you have it)
to the TA by email or canvas.
